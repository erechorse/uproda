# Implementation Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the Uproda CLI tool. The implementation is divided into several focused feature branches to ensure manageable, reviewable, and testable changes.

## 1. Branch: `feature/cli-structure`

**Goal:** Implement the basic command-line interface structure.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   Use the `clap` crate to define command-line arguments.
    *   The CLI should accept one or more file paths for upload.
    *   Add an optional argument for the target server URL (e.g., `--url <URL>`).
    *   Implement a basic handler that parses the arguments and prints the collected file paths and the target URL to the console.
    *   Ensure basic TDD principles are followed by writing a test that verifies argument parsing.

## 2. Branch: `feature/single-file-upload`

**Goal:** Implement the logic for uploading a single file.

*   **Prerequisites:** `feature/cli-structure`
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Create a new `uploader` module to encapsulate the upload logic.
    *   Within the `uploader` module, implement a function that takes a file path and a target URL.
    *   Use the `reqwest` and `tokio` crates to send the file's content as an asynchronous POST request.
    *   For initial testing, use a public endpoint like `httpbin.org/post`.
    *   Add a unit test for the upload function, potentially using a mock server or `httpbin.org`.

## 3. Branch: `feature/parallel-uploads`

**Goal:** Enable the concurrent upload of multiple files.

*   **Prerequisites:** `feature/single-file-upload`
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Modify the `main` function to handle multiple file path arguments.
    *   For each file path, spawn an asynchronous task using `tokio::spawn` that calls the single-file upload function.
    *   Use `futures::future::join_all` or a similar mechanism to wait for all upload tasks to complete.
    *   Report the success or failure of each upload.

## 4. Branch: `feature/progress-indicator`

**Goal:** Integrate progress bars to provide user feedback during uploads.

*   **Prerequisites:** `feature/parallel-uploads`
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Add the `indicatif` crate to the project dependencies.
    *   Implement a multi-progress bar setup.
    *   Create a main progress bar to track the overall progress (number of files uploaded / total files).
    *   For each individual file upload, create a separate progress bar to show the transfer progress (bytes sent / total bytes).
    *   Use `reqwest`'s streaming capabilities to feed the real-time upload progress to the `indicatif` progress bars.

## 5. Branch: `feature/error-handling-and-config`

**Goal:** Improve robustness through comprehensive error handling and flexible configuration.

*   **Prerequisites:** `feature/progress-indicator`
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Define custom error types using a crate like `thiserror` to handle various failure scenarios (e.g., file not found, network error, server error).
    *   Refactor the existing code to use `Result<T, E>` for all operations that can fail.
    *   Provide clear, user-friendly error messages.
    *   (Optional) Extend configuration options to allow reading the server URL from a configuration file (e.g., `config.toml`) or environment variables, in addition to CLI arguments.

## 6. Branch: `refactor/docs-and-cleanup`

**Goal:** Refactor the codebase, add documentation, and ensure code quality.

*   **Prerequisites:** `feature/error-handling-and-config`
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Review the entire codebase for clarity, maintainability, and performance.
    *   Add `rustdoc` comments to all public functions, structs, and modules.
    *   Run `cargo fmt` to ensure consistent formatting.
    *   Run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings -A clippy::pedantic` and fix all reported lints to adhere to the zero-warnings policy.
